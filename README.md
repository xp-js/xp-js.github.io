## 🖥️ About

**Microsoft Windows XP** experience.

This project exists purely for **nostalgia, experimentation, and fun**.
It is designed to be experienced **online only**.

## ⚙️ How it works
The project uses modern web technologies and custom JavaScript logic
to simulate the Windows XP desktop environment.

Future versions may include a **virtualized environment powered by DOSBox**
running directly in the browser.
